## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Homeway, we take our community's privacy and security very seriously. If any security issues are found, please report them directly to our developer team using our [support system](https://homeway.io/support). We will look into the reported issues and respond ASAP.

We offer a bug bounty program that's accessed on a case-by-case basis. Being a community-driven project, we only have a little revenue, but we want to pay the security research community for the time and effort. We will do our best to pay an industry-standard rate for security issues, depending on the severity of the issue.

If you have any questions, [contact us](https://homeway.io/support).
