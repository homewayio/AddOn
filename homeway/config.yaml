# Note when this version number changes, we must make a release to start a docker container build immediately, since HA will start looking for the new version.
# Basically: Make the final commit -> test and check lint actions (if a docker change, push to docker-test to ensure it builds) -> bump the version number -> create GitHub release.
# UPDATE THE CHANGE LOG!
